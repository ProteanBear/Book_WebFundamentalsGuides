# Building Components

Components are the building blocks of modern web applications. What best practices should you follow when building your own components so they can stand the test of time?

## [Custom Elements](customelements-hl=zh-cn.html) {#custom-elements}

Custom elements give developers the ability to extend HTML and create their own tags. Because custom elements are standards based they benefit from the Web's built-in component model. The result is more modular code that can be reused in many different contexts.

## [Shadow DOM](shadowdom-hl=zh-cn.html) {#shadow-dom}

Shadow DOM is a web standard that offers component style and markup encapsulation. It is a critically important piece of the Web Components story as it ensures that a component will work in any environment even if other CSS or JavaScript is at play on the page.

## [Best Practices](best-practices-hl=zh-cn.html) {#best-practices}

Because custom elements and shadow DOM are low-level primitives, it's not always clear how best to combine them to create a component that is robust and works well in many different environments. While you really can do just about anything with these APIs, here are a few best practices to help ensure your components work well anywhere.

## [Examples](examples/index-hl=zh-cn.html) {#examples}

HowTo-Components are a set of elements which demonstrate Custom Element and Shadow DOM best practices. These elements are not intended to be used in production, but are instead presented as a teaching aide to help map best practice suggestions to actual implementations.
